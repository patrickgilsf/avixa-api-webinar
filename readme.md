## environment setup and authentication

1. First, download NodeJS! https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
2. Second, run `npm install` on the command line to download all of the dependencies
3. Third, create a file at the root of the folder called '.env'. All of you API keys, passwords, IP addresses, and other specific information will go in there. 
4. Last, I made a .txt file called 'sampleEnv.txt' that mimics what your .env file will look like

each module has a comment at the top, letting you know what personal information is needed

once you have it all setup, run `npm start` to mimic the presenation

DM me with any questions!
